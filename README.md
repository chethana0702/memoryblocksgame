# Memory Blocks Game using OpenGL in Microsoft Visual Studio

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple Memory Blocks game developed using the OpenGL graphics library in Microsoft Visual Studio. The game is designed to test and improve your memory by matching pairs of blocks with the same texture. This README file provides instructions on how to set up and run the game, as well as an overview of its features.


## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Memory Blocks game, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (2019 or later recommended)
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) library
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [SOIL2](https://github.com/SpartanJ/SOIL2) (Simple OpenGL Image Library 2)

Ensure that you have these dependencies installed and configured in your Visual Studio project.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory-blocks-game.git
```

2. Open Microsoft Visual Studio and load the project by selecting the `.sln` file located in the repository.

3. Ensure that you have the OpenGL, GLEW, GLFW, and SOIL2 libraries correctly linked and configured in your project settings.

4. Build and run the project.

## How to Play

- When you start the game, you'll see a grid of face-down blocks.
- Your goal is to find and match pairs of blocks with the same texture.
- Click on two blocks to reveal their texture. If they match, they'll stay face-up. If not, they'll flip back face-down.
- Continue matching pairs until all blocks are face-up to win the game.

## Controls

- Use your mouse to click on the blocks to reveal their texture.
- Use the ESC key to exit the game at any time.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying various parameters in the source code. Some possible modifications include changing the grid size, adding new textures, or altering the game's difficulty level.
